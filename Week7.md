**Week 7**  
PHP Programming  
  
**Learning Activities**  
This week I watched a few hours of LinkedIn PHP courses and had to learn how to integrate Git into my IDE. This is not only for weekly work but for our group project as I have never used Git in a group setting.  
  
My group got together and discussed local environments and hosting options as well as figuring out our Trello setup and Discord setup.

**Content Insights**  
I have very little PHP knowledge so going through LinkedIn learning courses helped me understand the basics such as PHP syntax, variables, and data types, which helped me understand the fundamental concepts required for developing dynamic web applications. Through LinkedIn Learning courses, I learned how to use PHP to handle form submissions, work with databases, and interact with server-side scripts to create robust web applications.  
  
One of the key benefits of learning PHP is the ability to create reusable code snippets, which can be used to speed up development and improve the maintainability of your code. I also discovered how PHP is often used in conjunction with other web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create seamless and interactive user experiences.  
  
Overall, the knowledge I gained during the week has given me a strong foundation in PHP, which will be essential for the group project.  
  
**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
During my week of learning PHP, I gained valuable insights into the world of back-end web development. I learned how to use PHP to create dynamic and interactive web applications that can engage and delight users. I also gained an understanding of the role that PHP plays in the broader ecosystem of web development, and how it can be used in conjunction with other technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
  
As someone not interested in persuing web development I still think this content was great to learn for my interest in general IT but I believe will probably go unused by myself in the future.
