**Content Insights**  
Joomla and WordPress are very similar but WordPress appears to have a more user friendly UI, I like it more.  

Version control and backups are crucial in development and should not be relaxed on. Backups can also be used to migrate a server to a new host.  Basic Joomla/WordPress sites contain their base site files + the database and both of these are required or the site will not work. When migrating to a new host you need the files and the database which there are addons/tools that can import/export just the files, just the DB, or both at the same time. 

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
A few weeks in I still find working on the pracs and getting the website up and running more interesting than reading about it or watching a video about it and I find even though it's taking me more time I am understanding and learning more by doing, finding errors, researching errors, and fixing them. Web design itself does not interest me as a career move but the back end configuration and hosting has me intrigued.
