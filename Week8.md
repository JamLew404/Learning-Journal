**Week 8**  
WordPress: Developing Custom Themes  
  
**Learning Activities**  
This week I watched a few hours of LinkedIn courses to do with custom themes. I was particularly interested in the DRY design principals.   

I also spent time trying to sort out some CI/CD for the group assignment

**Content Insights**  
One of the key benefits of developing a custom WordPress theme is the ability to modularize the site. By separating the website's different components into modules, such as the header, footer, and sidebar, you can create a consistent layout across all pages. This allows you to make changes to the site's design and functionality with ease, as you only need to update the relevant modules rather than making changes on a page-by-page basis.  

A solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and PHP is required for the creation of a custom WordPress theme. You can also use pre-built frameworks such as Bootstrap or Foundation to speed up the development process. There are also many WordPress-specific tools and resources available that can help to create custom themes, such as the WordPress Theme Handbook.  

When developing a custom WordPress theme, it's important to consider the user experience and ensure that the design is both visually appealing and functional. It's also important to make sure that your theme is responsive, meaning it can adapt to different screen sizes and devices, and is optimized for speed and performance.  

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
Wordpress themes are not something I can see myself persuing outside of Uni but it was very interesting reading about the code modularisation and the DRY practices. This approach is not unique to WordPress and can be applied to other web development projects as well. By using modular code, you can save time and effort when making changes or updates to your website.
