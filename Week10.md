**Content Insights**  
UX is about creating an enjoyable and efficient user experience by understanding user needs and expectations.  
User-focused design involves research and feeback to inform decisions, unsuring a seamless end product. Good UX improves user satisfaction, boosts conversion rates, and minimizes friction which strengthens user loyalty and drives growth.  
If the UX is prioritized in the development workflow you will generally get a more intuitive product which benefits the creator/organisation and the user.   
  
**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
UX is a valuable topic to learn I think in any aspect of the IT industry because you're going to be working with a user and most likely creating some form of product, even if it's not just development but a service provided. UX Principles carry over to it all and are a valuable tool for me in the future as it gives an insight into the end user who is using the product I may be creating in the future.
