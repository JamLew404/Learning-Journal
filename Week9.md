*Learning Expiriment:*  
Theory:  
If I study a new concept or skill immediately before going to bed, my brain will consolidate the information during sleep, leading to better retention and recall of the information the next day.  
  
Test:  
To test this theory, I will divide a group of participants into two groups: Group A and Group B. Both groups will be given a list of 20 new vocabulary words to learn. Group A will study the words for 20 minutes before going to bed, while Group B will study the words for 20 minutes in the morning. The next day, both groups will take a vocabulary quiz to test their retention and recall of the words. The scores will be compared to see if there is a significant difference between the two groups.  
  
Explanation:  
The theory is based on the idea that the brain consolidates new information during sleep. By studying before bed, the brain has a chance to process and store the information, leading to better retention and recall the next day. The test involves a controlled experiment with two groups of participants to see if studying before bed leads to better retention and recall compared to studying in the morning. The vocabulary quiz will serve as a measure of learning, and statistical analysis will be used to determine if the results are significant. If the results show that studying before bed leads to better retention and recall, this could have implications for learning strategies and study habits.

**Content Insights**  
Sass allows for a modular approach to CSS and also for an easier way of CSS modification. Sass allows developers to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) standard by allowing a developer to make one change and it updates all of the CSS code.  
If you need to make a change to the site you can update the Sass code and it will flow the update through the code instead of having to do a manual find and replace and hoping you got it all.
This is very useful in a development environment and will be as it saves a lot of time and streamlines/automates the process. 

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
Sass is a valuable skill for front-end developers who are looking to create more efficient and maintainable CSS code.  
Having experience with Sass can also make you a more attractive candidate for front-end development roles that require proficiency in other front-end technologies such as JavaScript and HTML. Understanding the benefits and features of Sass can also make you more confident in working with CSS code and troubleshooting any issues that may arise.
