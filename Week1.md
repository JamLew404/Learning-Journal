**Week 1**  
**Learning Activities**  
The revision test was a huge learning activity for me as I have not done CSS/HTML in a few years.  
I have not used github much at all so learning github to create the weekly journal  
**Resources/Links**  
W3Schools was a big part in giving me a refresher on CSS/HTML  
**Estimated Hours**  
Five hours  
**Content Insights**  
I learned that markdown is the standard format for readme files on Github.  
My lack of memory of CSS/HTML prompted me to review online tutorials again which allowed me to work through the revision test. Concepts like best practices for HTML (using semantic instead of generic elements so things like web page crawlers and assistive technologies (screen readers) can interpret the page. I also didn't rememeber anything about task analysis so researching that again and learning it is about observing users in action to understand how they perform tasks and designing around that.  
**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
Quick skimming of previously read materials and keyword searching to work through the revision test allowed me to get a refresher on courses previously taken but forgotten.
