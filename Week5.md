**Content Insights**  
Child themes are an interesting tool in the CMS toolbag. Earlier in the course I was wondering about Themes and if I can just get one and modify it so learning about Child Themes has really checked a box for that. I like that you could create a Child Theme and continue updating the Parent theme and not have any impact on the Child. I also like that you can kind of see a Parent/Child as a redundancy or backup theme. You can Modify the Child enough to have the desired out come but perhaps if you forgot or missed something the Parent theme will still be there to provide themes so it's not a total disaster.

I have not used PHP/CSS/HTML in many years so I am very rusty. The LinkedIn Learning course was a good jog to my memory for PHP mainly but I think I'll have to use a lot of online resources when it comes to using these languages again.  

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
Learning about Child Themes is a good insight into CMS. I still feel that the CMS line of work is not for me but I'm still glad to be learning it because I like to learn how every aspect of IT works. If I was to go into CMS I feel Child Themes might not be that useful depending on the type of workplace. I feel most workplaces would try to create their own theme from the ground up so they can differentiate themselves from the competition. Perhaps it would be good to know if you're in a business cranking out basic web pages for paying customers and you can do a quick child theme to switch things up a bit?
