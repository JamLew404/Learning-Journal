**Week 3**  
WordPress: installation, settings, content, navigation, using themes and plugins
  
**Learning Activities**  
*  Installed Joomla on ScotchBox and played around with creating a site. This is the start of assignment 1.
*  Found a free template site and explored how to download and install a template in Joomla and then activate it. I then began modifying theme colours and layouts of content. 
*  After installing my first template it broke my whole Joomla local webpage, I could not access front or back end. I manually deleted the template from the file location but it was permanently broken. I had to cut my losses and re-install Joomla which set me back four hours.
*  Installed a Lightsail VM with a pre-configured Joomla instance. I spent way more time than I should have trying to move my site to this. I gave up for a day and came back the next day after watching about four YouTube videos on it and I understood exactly what I had to do. I successfully migrated my SQL database to my AWS instance, changed the configuration file to reflect the new DB, and it works! :)

**Content Insights**  
This week I spent a little bit of time reading about Joomla and watching a few YouTube tutorials on how to modify the site. I also spent time on finding and importing Templates and Addons. Majority of my time was spent on understanding how Joomla works on the back end including how it is installed and how it talks to the SQL Database. I can now confidently migrate an SQLDB and Joomla files to any host. I think perhaps I could have spent more time learning how to make my website look prettier in Joomla and understanding how to edit and modify the site but I feel for my own skills I have greatly increased confidence in using Linux commands, understanding MySQL and how some of the code works in it (like queries and DB/User creation), and understanding the relationship between Joomla/MySQL. 

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
I think this week I learned that if I am struggling to do something that is not working for me I need to take a break and re-plan. I spent way more time than I should have working on migrating the SQL DB to AWS and after giving up and coming back to it the next day with a plan I achieved more in less time. After giving up I watched multiple YouTube videos, asked ChatGPT, and came back the next day with a plan and it was successful. This is more of a self development and self learning week which I think reflects on employability as I have learned importance of my limits and dealing with those limits. E.G. taking a break and coming back with a clear head and a plan!
