**Week 3**  
WordPress: installation, settings, content, navigation, using themes and plugins
  
**Learning Activities**  
*  Installed Joomla on ScotchBox and played around with creating a site. This is the start of assignment 1.
*  Found a free template site and explored how to download and install a template in Joomla and then activate it. I then began modifying theme colours and layouts of content. 
*  After installing my first template it broke my whole Joomla local webpage, I could not access front or back end. I manually deleted the template from the file location but it was permanently broken. I had to cut my losses and re-install Joomla which set me back four hours.
*  Installed a Lightsail VM with a pre-configured Joomla instance. This has proven to be a struggle as I deleted the pre-installed Joomla files and replaced them with my own from my local host but this just returns an error that I am yet to resolve.

**Content Insights**  
This week I spent a lot of time watching youtube videos on how Joomla works and then in between watching them I was playing with Joomla to try and figure out how to use it. Because of the time sunk into trying to figure out Joomla, re-installing Joomla, and then trying to figure out how to host the site that I spent so much time trying to make, I ran out of time for any additional theory.
