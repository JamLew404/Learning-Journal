**Content Insights**  
In the professional environment, team meetings are a lot more in-depth than I thought or could have imagined. I like the idea of stand up meetings as I think back to the amount of forced meetings I've had over the years at different workplaces and they are long, drawn out, and very little is achieved. Stand-up meetings are a great idea for keeping it simple and getting to the point.  

Scrum meetings are very good for teams with short deadlines and regular meetings keep the team in sync and obstacles can be spotted early and overcome. They include daily scrum meetings, sprint planning, and sprint retrospective. stand up meetings are part of this.  

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
I think the agile framework for team meetings and following the guidelines are great to know and would come in handy at any workplace. Knowing these strategies for meeting would be beneficial in the professional environment. This content will be very useful for future work as well as my current workplace. I wish I knew more about this stuff when I was a department manager a few years ago!
